## Concurrent Memory Allocator
  A thread-safe memory allocator featuring segregated free lists with 8 size classes,
  bidirectional coalescing for fragmentation reduction, and fine-grained per-size-class
  locking for high concurrency. Implements first-fit allocation with block splitting
  and achieves data-race-free operation verified by ThreadSanitizer.
